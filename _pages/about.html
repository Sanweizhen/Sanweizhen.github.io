<p>I'm a versatile and self-taught creative with a passion for design, writing, and illustration. My educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Journalism, and I am currently pursuing a Master's in Design for Data Visualisation at University of the Arts, London.
<br>
   <br> My expertise spans various areas, such as data journalism, data visualisation, graphic design, digital illustration, and even cat sitting. I love taking on multidisciplinary projects that challenge me to learn and grow continuously. My curiosity and dedication to learning fuel my drive to excel in everything I do.</p>
